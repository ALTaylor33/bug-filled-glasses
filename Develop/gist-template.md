## Regex Components

### Anchors
anchors in JavaScript are used to create internal links within a web page, allowing users to navigate to specific sections or elements without leaving the page.
### Quantifiers
quantifiers are used in regular expressions to specify the number of occurrences of a pattern or character in a string. They allow you to define the quantity or range of matches you want to find.
### OR Operator
The OR operator is represented by the double vertical bar ||. It is a logical operator that performs a Boolean OR operation between two operands and returns the result.
### Character Classes
character classes are used in regular expressions to match a specific set or range of characters within a string. They allow you to define a group of characters that you want to match against.
### Flags
Flags are optional parameters that can be added to regular expressions to modify their behavior. Flags are appended after the closing slash of a regular expression and change how the pattern is interpreted or applied.
### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping and capturing are techniques used to isolate and extract specific parts of a matched string. They allow you to define subpatterns within a larger pattern and capture the matched content for further use.
### Bracket Expressions
bracket expressions are used in regular expressions to define a set of characters that can match a single character at a specific position. They are enclosed in square brackets [ ] and provide a way to specify a range or a list of characters to match.
### Greedy and Lazy Match
 Greedy and lazy match refer to matching behaviors of quantifiers. They determine how much of a string should be matched when multiple matches are possible.
### Boundaries
 Boundaries are used to match specific positions in a string rather than matching actual characters. Boundaries allow you to define patterns that match the beginning or end of a word, line, or input.
### Back-references
Back-references are used to refer to previously matched groups within the same regular expression pattern. They allow you to match the same content that was captured by a capturing group earlier in the pattern.
### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind are zero-width assertions that allow you to match patterns based on the presence or absence of certain conditions ahead or behind the current position in a string. They are also known as positive lookahead, negative lookahead, positive lookbehind, and negative lookbehind.
